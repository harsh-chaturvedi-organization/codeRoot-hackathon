This is our Hackathon project under the mentorship of Masai School *https://www.masaischool.com/* . 
### Hackathon Theme- Logistics and operation
### Problem statement-
In the current hustle of digitized market, the local vendors are finding it almost impossible to survive against not-reachable operation or logistic chain  and have to roam every street and corner to sell their product, hence struggle to find their customers.
### Solution- 
Creating a decentralized and easy to access logistics system where both users and local vendors can register, users can find the required options, and vendors can register their product and sell online while buyers can locate them in their nearby area.
